The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for D-Mart is calculated by weighing the cost of equity and cost of debt based on their proportions in the company's capital structure. The formula combines the cost of equity (Re), cost of debt (Rd), and the tax rate (Tc), adjusted for the market value of debt and equity.
